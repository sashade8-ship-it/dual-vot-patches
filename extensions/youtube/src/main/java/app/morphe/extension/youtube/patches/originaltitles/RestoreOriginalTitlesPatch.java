/**
 * Replaces the auto-translated video titles and descriptions with the original titles and descriptions,
 * and replaces the video titles with the titles submitted to DeArrow if enabled by the DeArrow patch.
 * DeArrow titles are used instead of the original titles, and videos without a DeArrow title
 * show the original title only if original titles are restored.
 * <p>
 * Responses do not include the original title, so it's fetched with {@link OriginalTitleRequest}.
 * The original description of the opened video is fetched with {@link OriginalDescriptionRequest}
 * when the video is opened, so it's available when the description panel is opened.
 * <p>
 * Elements are parsed on the main thread, where the original title cannot be fetched.
 * The element hook finds the translated titles and starts fetching the original titles.
 * If an original title is already available, the element is modified (including the
 * accessibility label). Otherwise the text hook replaces the title when it's laid out.
 * <p>
 * Elements do not show which text is the title, so a text is replaced only if it's verified
 * to be the title: the original title, which the element shows if the title is not translated,
 * or the title in the language of the app fetched with {@link LocalizedTitleRequest}, which is
 * fetched only if the element does not show the original title. If the text found as the title
 * is neither, the title is also fetched as shown in the lists, where titles can be auto-translated,
 * and in the language of the text, as elements can show the title in another language, such as
 * a search result shown in the language of the search.
 * Until the title is verified, the text found as the title by the layout of the element is shown
 * as loading, and it's shown again if it's not the title.
